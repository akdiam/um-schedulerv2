Fundamental principles of inorganic chemistry will be taught in the context of the role of metals in biological systems, with special emphasis on how this knowledge relates to commonly known phenomena.\r\nThe University of Michigan is a center for the research on the role of metals in biology, health, and the environment. Several faculty in the Department of Chemistry have world-class research programs in this area, but also faculty in Biophysics, Biological Sciences, Environmental Engineering, Pharmacology, the Life Science Institute, etc., are devoted to this topic. This is a very good platform to offer undergraduate students hands-on research experience at the University of Michigan. CHEM 303 is designed to satisfy the requirement for an advanced undergraduate class in Inorganic Chemistry, and is aimed at undergraduate students in their Sophomore or early Junior year. The class serves as an alternative to CHEM 302, but a special emphasis is put on the role of metals in biological systems, and the connection between fundamental (classroom) knowledge of biological processes with respect to metals, and their relation to commonly known phenomena, for example diseases, pollution, alternative energies, evolution, industrial processes, etc. This is an area of primary importance for health, life, and the environment, and hence, society as a whole. Despite the fundamental role of metals for life, this fascinating topic is clearly underrepresented in most undergraduate curricula. The topics of this course include metal homeostasis and related genetic diseases, the vital roles of metals in proteins, gene transcription, and regulation of cell function, diseases related to protein misfolding (neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer, Creutzfeldt-Jakob), heavy metal pollution in the environment (lead, mercury), and metals in medicine. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of this class, the undergraduate students will be advanced in the area of metals in biology, and ready for practical research experience in the following term. My goal is that a significant number of the students will be inspired through this course to work on related research projects. A good mechanism is to first form an interest group of faculty for the area of Metals in Life. Since these faculty belong to very different research areas spanning from Chemistry and Biology all the way to Pharmacy, Medicine, and Engineering, it is ensured that the students will have a wide and interdisciplinary group of faculty to talk to.\r\n\r\nA further mechanism will be incorporated to establish relationships between undergraduate students and faculty participating in the \u2018The Role of Metals in Life\u2019 program early on in phase 1. For this purpose, the homework assignment for the students will be to write a paper about 2 \u2013 3 research publications of a participating faculty.

The ideas and methods represented in the course include those drawn from empirical psychology, linguistics, philosophy, computer science and artificial intelligence, neuroscience, behavioral economics, and evolutionary biology. Rather than treat each approach separately, we focus on a set of relatively independent topics, each of which engages several of these approaches.\r\nTopics we will cover include: language, visual perception, rationality, decision-making, emotion, working memory, and moral judgment. With each topic, we will examine it at multiple levels: functional, computational, and neural. The aim is to arrive at an overview of the big ideas of cognitive science\u00e2\u0080\u0094the theoretical principles that constitute our current understanding of how our minds work.\r\nEach time we visit a topic, we will ask:\nWhat theoretical issues are at stake?\r\nHow are they being addressed?\r\nWhat are the key ideas?\r\nWhat are the basic phenomena, how were they discovered, and what counts as an explanation of them?"}, {"num": 209, "desc": "This course is designed to introduce students to the \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d and its impact on the contemporary study of language.

Through a progressing series of paper assignments, you will be asked to think about what it means to read and write the body, while practicing key techniques of academic writing such as close reading, narrative argument, and comparative analysis. In the final project for this course, you will be asked to repurpose one of your written essays into a new form (a performance, a visual project, a blog or other kind of digital presentation, etc.), in an effort to consider the very distinctions we make between texts and other kinds of media.  Course Requirements:This course will make use of a grading contract determined at the beginning of the semester between each student and the course instructor. Students will receive a document outlining of all of the course components required to receive a B in the course (essay completion and revision, peer review, participation and discussion, self-reflection, etc.) as well as a range of options that they can choose to complete in order to receive an A in the course (optional synchronous meetings, additional revision and reflection assignments, community engagement opportunities, etc.). Each student will be expected to follow the plan for success that they outline in the grading contract (with the understanding that the contract allows for flexibility, changing circumstances, and differences in student needs throughout the semester), and final grades will be assigned based on the work the student completes.Class Format:This course will primarily use Canvas for all asynchronous online components. We may also occasionally use Google forms and docs for collaborative work. Optional synchronous meetings with the instructor will be conducted through Zoom every Wednesday from 8:30-10am. Students should have access to a camera and microphone, especially for small group/breakout group work, but while students are encouraged they will not be required to turn on cameras during the synchronous meetings.

When we\r\ndiscuss today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patterns of school funding, the effects of racism are immediately evident, and they take\r\non historical context when we consider the gendered schooling of the Colonial Period, the denial of\r\nliteracy to African Americans during the era of slavery, the powerful anti-Catholic sentiments that led\r\nto the creation of a system of Catholic education in the U.S., and the boarding schools which attempted\r\nto expunge the American Indian heritages of children.

You will have a\r\ndual role in the simulation: you will play a character yourself, and you will also act as a\r\nproject leader and mentor to the younger participants.\r\n\r\nPOOT is run in cooperation with the Center for Middle Eastern and North African\r\nStudies and the School of Education at UM-Flint. The core of the simulation is anchored\r\nin the years 711 through 1492 and the cultures in and around what was known as Muslim\r\nSpain, or \u201cal-andalus.\u201d However, the simulation draws from all periods of history and all\r\nworld cultures. The simulation revolves around a trial - different each time the simulation\r\nis run -- based on events and people from history. While the details are everchanging,\r\ntimeless and universal themes, such as \"identity,\" \"freedom,\" and \"security,\"\r\nare the backdrop for POOT.\r\n\r\nThis class is different because you are responsible not just for your own learning, but for\r\nthe learning of younger peers who are depending on you. In order to fulfill that\r\nresponsibility, though, you will (collectively) need to understand and articulate a variety\r\nof cultural and historical perspectives, as filtered through the personalities that appear in\r\nthe simulation. We have chosen to utilize character-playing simulation for two reasons.\r\nFirst, we see great value in character playing as an exercise of the imagination. Being\r\nforced to \u201cwalk in the shoes\u201d of another, and to consider the ideas and the perspective of\r\nsomeone from another time or place, can be a powerful catalyst to learning. Secondly,\r\nboth you and the student participants will be asked to do this character playing in a taskoriented\r\nway. Mentors and students will learn about their character\u2019s lives, their points of \r\nview, and the societal contexts in which their characters lived. You will then be\r\npresented with a contemporary problem, which you will consider from the perspective of\r\nyour character. The idea is to help the students to construct a bridge between historical\r\ntimes and the present day, to gain a heightened appreciation for other worldviews, and to wrestle with some (hopefully) interesting questions in a way that will deepen our learning\r\nabout history\u2026and about ourselves.\r\nIt is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. To that, one might add\r\nthat the next best way to learn something is to play a game with it.

University student \"mentors\" (that's you) facilitate this diplomatic simulation (in which we create a scenario that becomes the \"reality\" of our world) and serve as gatekeepers, pushing the students to act in ways that are in keeping with the beliefs/constraints that the person they are portraying would hold and operate under. There is a complex structure in place for them to communicate with others, to issue press releases and otherwise express their interests and trade influence, and finally to introduce possible new actions into the simulated world. All of this is done with the support and with the assistance of the mentors.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the exercise is an attempt to give students a tangible window into the diplomatic process, with it's slow, thorny inner-workings. This course, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (AIC) simulation itself, are based on the idea that the most meaningful learning often happens when one is actively engaged in a purposeful activity. By participating in AIC as a mentor, we hope that you will get a chance to think deeply about (among other things) how people learn to take diverse perspectives, what it takes to foster thoughtful discourse, and the nature of diplomacy itself.\r\n\r\nAIC is also a project in the School of Education, and part of its purpose is to develop new ways that technology can support meaningful learning experiences with high school students.

Understanding computers means understanding the hardware/software process of how you and the computer work together to have the computer carry out a concept. In your introductory programming courses (e.g. EECS 280), you learned how to express a concept in terms of a high-level programming language such as C/C++. In EECS 370, you will see how a low-level language is executed by the hardware, and you will see how to put together basic, hardware building blocks to form the functional units of a computer. \r\nTo achieve these goals, you will design and \"build\" simple computers at various levels of detail. In this course, building will not mean connecting chips and gates. Rather, you will describe the hardware in diagrams, finite-state machines, and hardware simulators (written in C). To further your understanding of other topics, we will provide practice questions that will be discussed in the discussion sections. \r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\nStudents must have taken EECS 280. Depending on when you took EECS 280, you may not yet be familiar with programming C on Unix. We advise you to learn quickly. A brief overview of C vs. C++ will occur during the first discussion section of the semester.

This course is intended to do two things: to give you a solid, detailed understanding of how computers are designed and implemented, including the central processor and memory and I/O interfaces; and to make you aware of the numerous tradeoffs in design and implementation, their interaction, their realization in both historical and state-of-the-art systems, and trends that will affect them in future systems. We will cover instruction set architectures, pipelining (including basic pipelining, multiple-instruction-per-cycle machines, out-of-order instruction execution, and vector processing), memory systems (including caches and virtual memory), I/O interfaces, operating system issues, and basic multiprocessor systems. We will also do case studies on microprocessors and systems you may have used, perhaps including the P6 (Pentium Pro/II/III), Pentium 4, and the Sony PlayStation/2. \r\nA central part of EECS 470 is the detailed design of major portions of a substantial processor using the Verilog hardware design language (HDL). Portions of this work will be done individually as homeworks; the bulk of the work will be done in groups of three to five as a term project.

But a time is coming when Christian churches will understand this command in a much more comprehensive sense; and the \u2018Christian family\u2019 and \u2018Christian neighborhood\u2019 will be the grand ministry of salvation.\u201d This class examines how women writers took up this twin mission to Christianize their homes and families, and by extension, to Christianize their neighborhoods and nation. Their status as angels in the house, the civilizing force at the center of the domestic sphere, became the rhetorical landscape on which these writers became angels on the page, arguing on behalf of abolition, temperance, the protection of the family, and the civilizing of American society.

As English (rather than French or Latin) increasingly became a language in which culture could be conducted, the number and variety of works in the English vernacular burgeoned.  New professional, legal, and religious discourses vastly extended the functional range of the English language, so that the most important or influential activities of contemporary life were newly conducted or experienced in English.

I bring two broad questions to this course, both concerning the social purposes and effects of literary texts:  first, how imagined textual audiences in works like the Canterbury Tales or Piers Plowman sought to shape their flesh-and-blood first readers; and second, how vernacular texts, by changing the emerging English discourses (on legal evidence, spiritual experience, exotic anthropology, natural history, commerce, or civic deliberation, e.g.), also aimed for (and sometimes even achieved) broader social change.

The course includes field trips that allow students to get an up-close and personal look at pertinent environmental topics while learning how to hunt for news.\r\n Students benefit from detailed feedback that instructors provide on their writing, through a series of drafts that evolve to a final polished product. Many students have had their articles published in widely read newspapers and magazines. \r\nBy the end of this course, students will become adept at communicating complex environmental, scientific and public health issues in an engaging manner that will draw the public's attention. They will learn what constitutes news, and how they can sell their ideas to editors, consequently reaching a large segment of readers and viewers. The course will advance the student's knowledge of social media, including Twitter, and help them master the use of video to present their point of view. A final project includes producing a video that argues why an editor should publish the student's story, and why readers should care about it.

What is the purpose of art? Where do artists find their ideas?  Why do objects exert effects upon viewers? What is the relationship between ars and ingenium\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, between rules and creative license? What is the role of practical knowledge and what is the role of divine inspiration in the process of artistic creation? During this period (roughly from 1400 to 1780) we find that many different kinds of people\u00e2\u0080\u0094artists, poets, academicians, princely secretaries, clergymen\u00e2\u0080\u0094offered answers to such questions. The Humanist revival of ancient Greek and Roman literature and philosophy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was crucial to the early modern idea that the making and enjoying of visual art should be considered a philosophical activity. From the fourteenth century onward, treatises, dialogues and poems aimed at general educated readers fueled the discussion of how visual art affects our moral lives and how it reveals truths about the natural, human and divine worlds. The belief that art has an ethical purpose, that it engages the higher faculties of the mind, that it offers instruction as well as delight, contributed fundamentally to the modern conception of visual art as a guide to understanding and means of representing the human condition. Artists themselves often reflected on their activity in their works and expressed their ideas by pushing the limits of what could be stated in material form. This seminar will offer an introduction to early modern European thought about visual art on the basis of selected writings in English translation and the evidence of paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints, some of them in the University of Michigan Museum of Art.

Yet while artists depicted Detroit's industry as an abstract emblem of twentieth century progress\u2014and later of dystopian decline\u2014the city has a complicated labor, racial, and political history that its art, architecture, and urban planning help us to question. This seminar examines how Detroit has been presented in art, and the role that the arts and architecture have played in the city from the 1880's to the present. We will consider both works produced in Detroit that defined a technological future and urban culture for the world and those that have particular local histories, from the sleek factories that heralded modern architecture in America to the artificial past that Henry Ford assembled at Greenfield Village, from the heroic worker figures of Diego Rivera's murals to the controversies surrounding the Joe Louis monument and street art, from \"ruin porn\" and gentrification to prospects for the future.This year we will devote extra attention to researching Detroit arts during the rise of the Black Power movement, through the 1967 rebellion or riot and into the city's emergence as a majority-Black metropolis.\r\n\r\nRequired texts (also available on reserve) will include Terry Smith, Making the Modern: Industry, Art and Design in America.

It is based upon the student\u2019s initial formulation of a dissertation topic. By the close of the second year, students are required to give the DGS a tentative list of three members of the Preliminary Examination Committee. The precise areas of questioning and the bibliography begin to be developed by the student in consultation with members of the Committee at a meeting convened well in advance of the examination, but no later than the beginning of the term prior to the term in which the student intends to take the Preliminary Examination.\r\n\r\nThe Preliminary Examination is designed to consolidate and test students\u2019 command over the art and scholarship of their major field of study: students must demonstrate up-to-date knowledge of principal artists, genres and monuments, and familiarity with scholarly literature and art historical problems. The examination is set by the student\u2019s primary advisor (normally the eventual chair of his/her Dissertation Committee) and at least one other faculty member from the History of Art. It is read by the student\u2019s Preliminary Examination Committee, which consists of the two faculty members who set the examination, and a third reader who also takes part in the oral follow-up exam. In fields where only one faculty member may be able to set the exam, it is still read by the two additional faculty on the committee.\r\n\r\nThe written Examination, taken on two consecutive days, consists of four areas of questioning: the general field (historically and geographically defined) from which the dissertation is drawn [Part I] and three more focused areas broadly relevant to the proposed dissertation topic [Part II]. Depending on the character of the dissertation and the needs of the student, the areas of questioning in Part II may focus on a particular medium or genre, a critical category or concept, a body of comparative material, or a related minor field. One area of questioning may be devoted to theoretical or methodological issues pertinent to the dissertation or to a topic in a cognate discipline of special importance to the student\u2019s dissertation research. In preparing for Part I of the Exam, a student discusses the general field with his/her primary advisor, who is responsible for seeing that the student covers an appropriate range of material. Examples of general fields include \u201cIslamic Art and Architecture Between the Seventh and the Thirteenth Centuries,\u201d \u201cIslamic and Christian Worlds in the Mediterranean Basin, Tenth to Thirteenth Centuries,\u201d \u201cModern European Painting and Sculpture, 1848-1945,\u201d \u201cSeventeenth-Century Netherlandish Art,\u201d and \u201cArts of China in the Song Period, 960-1279.\u201d As a general rule of thumb, a student should expect that studying for the general field portion of the preliminary exam will prepare him/her to teach undergraduate survey courses in that area. After discussing the general field with the primary advisor, the student then submits to the Preliminary Examination Committee a paragraph defining and delimiting the general field, prepares a bibliography of key texts, and identifies a corpus of works of art for which s/he will be responsible. In preparing for Part II of the Examination, a student composes a bibliography and proposes three questions for each of the three focus areas; these questions serve as the basis for the exam in each of the three focus areas.\r\n\r\nTiming of the Preliminary Exam\r\n\r\nIn order to remain in good standing in the program, the student must pass the Preliminary Examination by the end of the winter term of his/her third year. Students who enter the program with a prior M.A. must pass the Preliminary Examination before the end of the winter term of their second year. The Preliminary Examination is taken during the last week of classes. The oral defense takes place by the end of the following week.\r\n\r\nExamination Format\r\n\r\nThe Preliminary Examination consists of three parts. The written portion is taken on two successive days.\r\n\r\nPart I: This section consists of written responses to questions posed in relation to slides, photographs or objects drawn from the general field of the student\u2019s specialization. Students are given two hours to write the answers, either longhand or on a portable computer. Upon completion of the test, the student immediately submits the essays or disk to the Graduate Program Coordinator for distribution to the Committee.\r\n\r\nPart II: The second part consists of three long essays on issues raised by the material in the designated areas. Typically these questions, developed from questions proposed by the student, are thematically oriented and directed toward matters of theory, criticism and interpretation, historiography and bibliography. Students are given two hours to write each of the three essays (selecting one questions from a choice of two in each case), either longhand or on a portable computer. Immediately upon completion of each test, the student submits the essay or disk to the Graduate Program Coordinator for distribution to the Committee.\r\n\r\nPart III: The final component is an oral examination of one and one half hours taken within one week of the written portions of the Examination. The oral is administered by the entire committee of three examiners and serves as an opportunity to discuss issues not addressed, or insufficiently treated in the written Exam. This is also an occasion for beginning to discuss the student\u2019s preparation of the dissertation prospectus.\r\n\r\nA student must pass all parts of the preliminary examination.

It addresses the need for a scientific model to explain human knowledge of language that also makes predictions about its representation in the mind. The focus here is on human language as a specific cognitive capacity restricted to humans, rather than on the individual languages (e.g., English, Arabic, Hindi) that are made possible by the existence of this capacity. For this reason, the course explores in detail many structural properties that are common across different languages, even those that clearly do not share a common recent past. A simple example: all languages have specific strategies to ask questions that make them different from affirmative sentences (e.g., English uses special question words \u2014 \u2018who\u2019, \u2018what\u2019 and so on \u2014 as most languages do). In order to explain this and many other common properties of human language, a scientific hypothesis that has been explored in depth is that a large part of human knowledge of language is biologically determined, and maybe innate. This is further supported by the fact that normal children effortlessly learn their native language at an amazing speed, despite the complexity of the task at hand (compare trying to learn for example Korean or Turkish as an adult, with years of language classes), and despite variation and deficiencies of the language input they are exposed to.\r\n\r\nIt is also clear, however, that there is a huge diversity among human languages, which can be illustrated only in an unfair way in this short description (e.g., only some languages change the sentence structure in a regular question: you say \u2018Who do you like?\u2019 in English, instead of \u2018You like who?\u2019, a possible word order similar to the one would find for instance in Chinese). Given this kind of diversity, which will be made clear, children need to be exposed to some minimum input of a particular language in order to be able to acquire it proficiently.

Beginning with Gauss\u2019 law of quadratic reciprocity, the Langlands program encapsulates important results such as Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem and the Sato\u2013Tate Conjecture. One of the main goals of this body of work is to relate two very different types of objects: representations of algebraic groups (e.g., GL_n) on the one hand, and representations of Galois groups on the other. The aim of this course will be to explain the local version of this story.

A central question is the adequacy of deductive reasoning: Can all the consequences of a set of assumptions be obtained from those assumptions by a sequence of very simple inferences? This question is an instance of a general theme that runs through much of mathematical logic, namely the interplay between mathematical statements (which are to be manipulated in the desired simple inferences) and the mathematical structures that they describe (which underlie the notion of logical consequence). \r\n\r\nThis is devoted to making this interplay precise and establishing a positive answer to the central question in some situations, including the particularly important case of first-order logic. This logic with its simple inferences serves as the explicit or implicit foundation for essentially all mathematical reasoning. In this connection, I\u2019ll also discuss at least one alternative way of verifying correctness in first-order reasoning. This way, though farther from intuition than the simple inferences mentioned above, is in general much more efficient and has found applications in automated theorem-proving.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the course will indicate why first-order logic plays such a central role in mathematics. It is easy to produce logical systems stronger than first-order logic, and one might be tempted to use them as an improved foundation for mathematics. But the notions of \u201cconsequence\u201d for these systems are necessarily far more complicated and cannot be captured by any reasonable step-by-step inferences. A mathematics based on them could not have proofs in anything like the usual sense of the term.\r\n\r\nA third part of the course uses the interplay between mathematical statements and the structures they describe, to establish some results in other areas of mathematics. These results do not directly involve logical matters, but their proofs are based on the results from logic proved earlier in the course. One example is the existence of the models used in non-standard analysis.\r\n\r\nOptional: Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic; Peter G.

It follows that the spaces Hi(X(C),Q') come equipped with an action of the group G = Aut(C) of automorphisms of the field C. This interaction between the topology of X(C) and the representation theory of G leads to a fascinating story that has been at the heart of numerous fundamental advances in twentieth century mathematics.

You will have a\r\ndual role in the simulation: you will play a character yourself, and you will also act as a\r\nproject leader and mentor to the younger participants.\r\n\r\nPOOT is run in cooperation with the Center for Middle Eastern and North African\r\nStudies and the School of Education at UM-Flint. The core of the simulation is anchored\r\nin the years 711 through 1492 and the cultures in and around what was known as Muslim\r\nSpain, or \u201cal-andalus.\u201d However, the simulation draws from all periods of history and all\r\nworld cultures. The simulation revolves around a trial - different each time the simulation\r\nis run -- based on events and people from history. While the details are everchanging,\r\ntimeless and universal themes, such as \"identity,\" \"freedom,\" and \"security,\"\r\nare the backdrop for POOT.\r\n\r\nThis class is different because you are responsible not just for your own learning, but for\r\nthe learning of younger peers who are depending on you. In order to fulfill that\r\nresponsibility, though, you will (collectively) need to understand and articulate a variety\r\nof cultural and historical perspectives, as filtered through the personalities that appear in\r\nthe simulation. We have chosen to utilize character-playing simulation for two reasons.\r\nFirst, we see great value in character playing as an exercise of the imagination. Being\r\nforced to \u201cwalk in the shoes\u201d of another, and to consider the ideas and the perspective of\r\nsomeone from another time or place, can be a powerful catalyst to learning. Secondly,\r\nboth you and the student participants will be asked to do this character playing in a taskoriented\r\nway. Mentors and students will learn about their character\u2019s lives, their points of \r\nview, and the societal contexts in which their characters lived. You will then be\r\npresented with a contemporary problem, which you will consider from the perspective of\r\nyour character. The idea is to help the students to construct a bridge between historical\r\ntimes and the present day, to gain a heightened appreciation for other worldviews, and to wrestle with some (hopefully) interesting questions in a way that will deepen our learning\r\nabout history\u2026and about ourselves.\r\nIt is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it.

University student \"mentors\" (that's you) facilitate this diplomatic simulation (in which we create a scenario that becomes the \"reality\" of our world) and serve as gatekeepers, pushing the students to act in ways that are in keeping with the beliefs/constraints that the person they are portraying would hold and operate under. There is a complex structure in place for them to communicate with others, to issue press releases and otherwise express their interests and trade influence, and finally to introduce possible new actions into the simulated world. All of this is done with the support and with the assistance of the mentors.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the exercise is an attempt to give students a tangible window into the diplomatic process, with it's slow, thorny inner-workings. This course, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (AIC) simulation itself, are based on the idea that the most meaningful learning often happens when one is actively engaged in a purposeful activity. By participating in AIC as a mentor, we hope that you will get a chance to think deeply about (among other things) how people learn to take diverse perspectives, what it takes to foster thoughtful discourse, and the nature of diplomacy itself.\r\n\r\nAIC is also a project in the School of Education, and part of its purpose is to develop new ways that technology can support meaningful learning experiences with high school students.

Why do we sometimes get our way while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire?

Another sense is moral: you want your research to promote the cause of justice, for instance by affording people (including, if applicable, its subjects) opportunities to achieve and express important understandings, including understandings of the natural and social worlds that might enable the identification and remedy of inequities and oppressions.

The overall scope of the work will vary depending on the research area but it should be of sufficient quality, depth and originality to be published in peer reviewed scientific journals.  The Dissertation Committee together with the student and mentor determine when the research is of sufficient quality and quantity to be appropriate for the Ph.D. dissertation.\r\n\r\nDissertation Committee \r\nIt is the responsibility of the student to set up the dissertation committee and organize timely meetings.  This committee is intended to monitor students\u2019 progress and help the student in several ways: \r\n\r\n1.  Develop a research program suitable for obtaining the Ph.D. degree.  \r\n2.  Provide guidance during the course of the research and offer suggestions for future directions.  \r\n3.  Ensure that the quality and quantity of research is suitable for obtaining the Ph.D.   \r\n4.  Help the student and mentor determine when sufficient research has been completed to prepare the dissertation.  \r\n\r\nIdeally, the committee is formed soon after students pass the Preliminary Exam and the first meeting should be held when the research is still in its early stages.  Although the length of committee meetings can vary greatly, it is recommended that approximately 2 hours be set aside for each committee meeting.  The following information is intended to help students, mentors and committee members take greatest advantage of the dissertation committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nForming the committee\r\nThe Committee must be formally established with Rackham prior to the first meeting.  Rackham policy states the dissertation committee must have at least four members, three of whom are regular members of the graduate faculty and two of whom are from the candidate\u2019s home program.  Students are strongly encouraged to include a fifth committee member so that the committee will have a sufficient number in the event one member cannot be at the dissertation defense due to scheduling conflicts, leaving the University, etc.   The committee must have a chair (student\u2019s mentor), or two co-chairs, and a cognate member who holds at least a 50% appointment in a Rackham doctoral program and does not hold any fraction of an appointment in the candidate\u2019s home program.   Further clarification of criteria for committee membership is provided in the Rackham Student Handbook of Policies and Procedures ; students are urged to refer to that source.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst committee meeting\r\nThis must be held within six months after passing Prelims (or before the December holiday break for students who take prelims in the Spring).  The student should prepare a written proposal describing a potential line of dissertation research.   This need not be a formal proposal in NIH style (as was prepared for Prelims) and it is not intended to be the final proposal, because the committee can help provide valuable input for developing the research plan.  The proposal should contain a hypothesis and specific aims, sufficient background and preliminary data to justify the work, and a general outline of the experimental plan to accomplish the aims.  Although the format and length will vary depending on the student and the project, 4 or 5 pages should generally be sufficient.  The proposal should be distributed to the committee one week before the meeting to allow time for committee members to digest the information.  The student should begin the meeting with an oral presentation describing the proposal and pertinent research conducted thus far (PowerPoint encouraged).  This is followed by discussion and suggestions from committee members, and ultimately committee members expressing their view as to whether the proposed research would be sufficient for obtaining the Ph.D.  Ideally, the meeting should end by setting the goals to be accomplished prior to the next meeting and the approximate time of the next meeting.  The chair of the committee should prepare a written report of the meeting (see below). \r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent committee meetings\r\nSubsequent committee meetings should be held at least once a year, more frequently if considered desirable by the student, mentor, or committee.  The goal of these meetings is for the student to present progress and for the committee to provide input to the student and mentor as to whether satisfactory progress is being made, if the student is on course, and ultimately to help the student and mentor decide when sufficient research has been conducted for writing the Ph.D. dissertation.  One week prior to the meeting, the student should distribute to the committee a progress report that includes the hypothesis and specific aims (updated as needed from the original proposal) and research findings and interpretations obtained since the last meeting.  It would be helpful for the student to indicate in this report his/her publications, abstracts and presentations relevant to the dissertation research.  The student should begin the meeting with an oral presentation (PowerPoint recommended) reviewing the material in the progress report.  This should be followed by a discussion and suggestions from the committee.  The meeting should end by discussing next steps, goals and setting an approximate date for the next meeting.\r\n\r\nReports of committee meetings\r\nThe chair of the dissertation committee should submit a written report to the Graduate Program administrator within two weeks after the meeting.  This report should be signed by both the mentor and the student and distributed to all committee members.  This report should indicate the date of the meeting, committee members present (and absent), and a written narrative describing the events that took place at the meeting.  For the first meeting, this narrative should be sufficiently detailed as to indicate what has been proposed and whether it is feasible and sufficient as dissertation research.  For subsequent meetings, it should specify progress and if this is sufficient relative to the goals set at the last meeting.  It should include any deficits that were identified and recommendations of the committee.  The report should include goals to be accomplished prior to the next meeting and approximate date of the next meeting.  \r\n\r\nRole of the mentor and the committee\r\nAlthough mentoring styles vary tremendously amongst faculty and depending on the student, a few general comments may be helpful.  The Ph.D. research may be considered a collaboration between the student and mentor.  It is appropriate for the mentor to provide substantial input and advice regarding development of the research plan, interpretation of results, and determination of next steps.  Although this is a collaborative effort, the student should be the driving force.  The committee should provide oversight and feedback, and should help the student and mentor in development and subsequent modification of the overall research plan.  The committee should not force the student and mentor to conduct specific experiments; rather it should serve in an advisory capacity, and ultimately pass judgment as to whether the research and written dissertation are sufficient for the Ph.D.  The student is encouraged to seek input from individual committee members outside the scheduled committee meetings."}, {"num": 995, "desc": "Dissertation research by doctoral student admitted as a Candidate."}], "PIBS": [{"num": 550, "desc": "Description not currently available"}, {"num": 600, "desc": "Description not currently available"}, {"num": 750, "desc": "Description not currently available"}, {"num": 800, "desc": "This course consists of seminars and special presentations.

It was a paradoxical place. On the one hand, its social system was marked by an enormous gap between the rich and the poor, and the overwhelming majority of the population consisted of serfs deprived of legal rights and subjected to the unchecked authority of the nobility. On the other hand, the country was governed by an elected parliament and the \u201ccitizens\u201d (a category exclusive to the nobility) enjoyed rights and liberties almost unheard of in pre-modern Europe. After the late 16th century, even the king was elected rather than hereditary. As the Reformation was tearing Europe apart with confessional violence, the Polish-Lithuanian Republic was a refuge of relative toleration and peace. But whatever the merits or weaknesses of this unusual state, it proved incapable of withstanding the rise of absolutist monarchies in the countries surrounding it. After decades of increasingly aggressive interference in the Republic\u2019s internal affairs, Russia, Prussia, and Austria joined together in 1795 to wipe Poland entirely off the map. Rather than ending this particular story, however, the country\u2019s partition only launched a new era, as a vibrant nationalist movement began a century-long struggle for the restoration of Polish independence.

One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics; one serious drawback was the existence of a censorship apparatus which made criticism of the policies of the existing regimes very difficult (though not impossible). Nonetheless, in certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were able to be more incisive, frank, and provocative than is generally possible within the profit-driven, entertainment-oriented Hollywood film industry. This is not to say that the Communist regimes themselves gave priority to ameliorating the living conditions of their ethnic minorities or of women. But talented and committed filmmakers were able to take advantage of the progressive official pronouncements of these regimes with regard to ethnic and gender issues in order to craft powerful films, films which the regimes had no grounds to suppress or censor.\nThis course will study some of the most important films made in four thematic categories:\r\n\r\nthe Holocaust \u2014 the reactions of people in East Central Europe to the genocidal plans of the Nazis, from indifference and collaboration to heroic acts of altruism\r\nethnic discrimination and its consequences in more recent years \u2014 the depressed economic status of the Roma (Gypsies); animosity among Croats, Serbs, Moslem Bosnians and Albanians, leading to Yugoslavia's past and present civil wars \u2014 as well as the countervailing examples of a commonality of humanistic values and peaceful coexistence among people of these ethnicities\r\nwomen's lives under state socialism \u2014 women in the work force in large numbers, but plagued by a \"double\" or \"triple\" burden, with continued primary responsibility for domestic work and child care, as well as by persistent patriarchal attitudes toward sex and marriage in society as a whole\r\nthe response of Central Europe's leading women filmmakers, who, in different contexts and with different stylistic approaches, have presented heroines who rebel and struggle against the patriarchal order\r\n\r\nWe will view and discuss films from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia, and Macedonia dealing with the above issues.

What is the purpose of art? Where do artists find their ideas?  Why do objects exert effects upon viewers? What is the relationship between ars and ingenium\u2014that is, between rules and creative license? What is the role of practical knowledge and what is the role of divine inspiration in the process of artistic creation? During this period (roughly from 1400 to 1780) we find that many different kinds of people\u2014artists, poets, academicians, princely secretaries, clergymen\u2014offered answers to such questions. The Humanist revival of ancient Greek and Roman literature and philosophy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was crucial to the early modern idea that the making and enjoying of visual art should be considered a philosophical activity. From the fourteenth century onward, treatises, dialogues and poems aimed at general educated readers fueled the discussion of how visual art affects our moral lives and how it reveals truths about the natural, human and divine worlds. The belief that art has an ethical purpose, that it engages the higher faculties of the mind, that it offers instruction as well as delight, contributed fundamentally to the modern conception of visual art as a guide to understanding and means of representing the human condition. Artists themselves often reflected on their activity in their works and expressed their ideas by pushing the limits of what could be stated in material form. This seminar will offer an introduction to early modern European thought about visual art on the basis of selected writings in English translation and the evidence of paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints, some of them in the University of Michigan Museum of Art.

Movies like Singin in the Rain, for example, have been consistently placed in the top ten of American films ever made by critics here and in Europe.

In the process, Polish culture will be defined in all its distinctiveness but with clear attention to the qualities shared with the cultures of other Slavic and Central European nations and states. Students will analyze how literary and non-literary texts (verbal and non-verbal) are constructed, how meanings are created and transmitted, how real and perceived connections between the author and the audience are developed.\r\n\r\n  This will allow students to enhance their talents for persuasive and expository presentations and allow them to become \u201cintentional\u201d communicators and receivers of communication.

Two central themes throughout the course are:\r\n(a) The strong law of large numbers (SLLN).\r\n(b) The central limit theorem (CLT).\r\nThe strong law is the law of averages, that for example the fraction of heads in N tosses of a fair coin tends to 1/2 as N becomes large, with probability 1. The central limit theorem proves that the fluctuation in the number of heads from N/2 is approximately the square root of N times a Gaussian random variable with mean 0. The course begins with the proof of theorems (a) and (b) for independent random variables. Specializing to Bernoulli variables, we then interpret these theorems in terms of random walk on the integers Z. With the introduction of some further ideas, most notably zero-one laws, and the reflection principle, we prove for Bernoulli variables the law of the iterated logarithm, which is an optimal strengthening of SLLN.\r\nThe remainder of the course develops deep generalizations of the ideas discussed in the previous paragraph. The first of these is the idea of a Martingale, which is ubiquitous in current research, particularly in mathematical finance. Next is the notion of measure-preserving transformation and ergodicity, from which one obtains an optimal SLLN for general independent random variables. Finally Brownian motion is constructed as a generalized CLT. Time permitting, there will be also some discussion of Markov chains and information theory.\r\n\r\n\n For more information on this course, please visit the Department of Mathematics webpage Course Requirements:Required Text: Probability Theory and Examples, R.

Corporations are among the wealthiest and most powerful institutions on the world's stage today. At the same time, corporations are more vulnerable than ever before. Globalization unleashed a set of competitive forces that place firms at risk, no matter their size. Managers face enormous pressure. Their firms' wealth and power act as a kind of magnet. Civil society routinely asks corporations to invest directly in our social life. Regardless of their productive capabilities, firms field requests to invest in such areas as education and health care. Managers must decide what, if anything, to do. And, at the same time, these same managers need to marshal their resources to produce and deliver high quality and profitable goods and services in a very competitive global marketplace.

Online comment culture reveals a lot about our contemporary conceptions of the public sphere. Comment sections in response to content can serve as a civic participatory space for differing perspectives, and, at their best, allow users to interact with diverse and differing perspectives. However, comment culture can quickly become uncivil and derogatory. In this course, we will focus on understanding and analyzing the rhetorical strategies of online comment culture, from places like that strive to have civil participatory spaces to the strategies of the subcultural troll. We will identify some of the rhetorical conventions of civil (and uncivil) commenting, and question what constitutes normative online communication.
