## ⚡️UM-Scheduler 

This app allows students at UM to schedule their classes without the sluggishness that comes with schedule building through Wolverine Access. 

##  🛠Tools

I used React for the front end, and Node/Express for the back end. I also used Python to scrape the class descriptions from the LSA course guide, as well as to generate the links to each class's course guide page and each class's ATLAS page.

## 💣Issues

This was my first project in JS let alone React, so there was a lot to learn, and the structure of this project kinda reflects this. However, I did learn a ton and will take what I learned into whatever project comes up next 🔛🔝🔜✔️
